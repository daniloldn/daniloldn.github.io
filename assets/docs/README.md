# Dissertation upload instructions

Place your dissertation PDF at:

```
assets/docs/dissertation.pdf
```

The page `dissertation.html` expects that filename and will embed and provide a download link when present.

Keep file sizes reasonable (recommended < 10MB) for faster loading. Generate a thumbnail at `images/thumbs/02.jpg` if you want a custom preview on the homepage.
